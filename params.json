You can retrieve the Z3 binaries from <https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases>.\r\n\r\nThe tool has been tested on Mac OS X 10.10 and Windows 7, but should otherwise also work on any *nix platform and newer Windows versions.\r\nAssuming that Haskell binaries are in your `PATH`, you can run the tool by writing `p3-fpromela --input [input_file]` where `[input_file]` is the path to your fPromela and corresponding TVL file without file extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn accompanying suite of benchmarks is available from <https://github.com/modelsteam/p3-benchmarks>.\r\n",
